Jsonnet Playground
==================

This is largely inspired by the work done on golang playground and takes advantage of the go-jsonnet
program to give you the similar features. As soon as go-jsonnet has a fmt function it will be added
in here as well. Until then we will all just have to suffer with sad unformatted code for our playground.
